## Pull requests

We accept pull requests to Cookie Box for:

* Fixing bugs
* Adding new features

Not all features proposed will be added but we are open to having a conversation
about a feature you are championing.

Here's a quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Run the tests. This is to make sure your starting point works. Run `HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare` to create the test database. Tests can be run via `bundle exec rspec`

3. Create a new branch and make your changes. This includes tests for features!

4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request. For more information, see
[Github's pull request help section](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

5. Make sure you do not delete/update the existing cassettes as tests are dependent on them.

6. Delete log/development.log and capybara-*.html.

At this point you're waiting on us. Expect a conversation regarding your pull
request; Questions, clarifications, and so on.
